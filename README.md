# Drago clon page


![Logo](https://drago.pe/_nuxt/img/drago.5993e51.png)



The following project is a clone of the [drago.pe](https://drago.pe/) website, made with 
the purpose of deepening my learning in the `REACT JS` library.



This project makes use of `react-router-dom` for the navigation between 
the different pages, providing a better user experience since it doesn't 
require the page to refresh to switch to another one.


Dependencies used for the development of this project:

- React
- React Router Dom
- Fontawesome
- Sass
- Swiper 




## Prerequsites

- Node 14+
## Quick Overview

If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via 
`npm install -g create-react-app`, we recommend you uninstall the 
package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` or `yarn global remove create-react-app` 
to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)
 comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.
